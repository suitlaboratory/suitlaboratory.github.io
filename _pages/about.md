<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my Ph.D. from Sorbonne Universit√©, Paris, France, in 2018, under the direction of Pascal Laugier (Member, European Academy of Sciences) and Quentin Grimal.

From 2018 to 2020, I was in Ferrara Lab at Stanford University for postdoctoral research training under the direction of Katherine W. Ferrara (Member, National Academy of Engineering).

I received the best talk award at the IBDW (2017) and the traveling award of IUS (2017), co-chaired a session at ESUCB 2017.

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University.

I received support of ‚ÄòShanghai High-Level Overseas Talent Program‚Äô and a grant from the ‚ÄòShanghai Sailing Program‚Äô.

I serve as a reviewer for academic journals including IEEE TUFFC„ÄÅUltrasonics„ÄÅIEEE TMI.

# ‚ú°Ô∏è Research Interests
